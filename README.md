# Alschool-Assignment-2

This project contains two basic HTML web pages built **without any CSS**, as part of an AltSchool Africa task. It demonstrates simple structuring with semantic HTML, media elements, and tabular data.

## 📁 Files Included

1. **table.html**  
   - Displays a table of all the schools and available courses at AltSchool Africa.
   - Organized with proper semantic elements: `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<ul>` for listing courses.
   - Links to the second page: `media.html`.

2. **media.html**  
   - A creative multimedia page that presents a personal story using various HTML media elements.
   - Includes:
     - `<picture>` element with three `<source>` tags for responsive image loading (mobile, tablet, and laptop).
     - `<video>` and `<audio>` tags with fallback sources.
     - `<blockquote>` for a personal quote.
   - Links back to `table.html`.

## 🛠 Usage Instructions

- Open `table.html` in your browser to view the courses and navigate to the media page.
- Ensure you provide actual file paths or URLs for the image, video, and audio files used in `media.html`:
  - `mobile.jpg`, `tablet.jpg`, `laptop.jpg`, `default.jpg`
  - `story.mp4`, `story.webm`
  - `voice.mp3`, `voice.ogg`

## 📌 Notes

- This project is strictly created **without CSS** to emphasize HTML structure and capabilities.
- Built for educational and demonstration purposes under the AltSchool Africa curriculum.
